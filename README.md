Lightweight, git-like content-addressable storage notes. See [docs/content-addressable-store.md](docs/content-addressable-store.md) for implementation guidance in C (object model, serialization, and build steps). For a slow, minimal, task-by-task implementation plan (including GitHub push steps), see [docs/step-by-step-plan.md](docs/step-by-step-plan.md).
